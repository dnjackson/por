As our dependence on technology increases, the design of software matters more than ever before. Why then is so much software flawed? Why hasn’t there been a systematic and scalable way to create software that is easy to use, robust, and secure?

Examining these issues in depth, _The Essence of Software_ introduces a theory of software design that gives new answers to old questions. Daniel Jackson shows how a software system can be viewed as a collection of interacting concepts. Through this radical and original perspective, Jackson lays out a practical path, accessible to anyone—from strategist and marketer to UX designer, architect, or programmer—for making software that is empowering, dependable, and a delight to use.
