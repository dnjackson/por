### Where can I learn more?

From the book, of course! But also a [sample chapter](/posts/sample-chapter), my [ACM tech talk](/posts/acm-tech-talk), and this [summary](/posts/distillation). Questions about the book or concept design? Feedback? Join us at the [software concept forum](http://forum.softwareconcepts.io)!

### Why did you write this book?

In my career in software, I've seen many good languages, tools and methods adopted. But none had the impact we'd hoped for. I came to realize that there's one thing that makes for great software: conceptual clarity in the design. So I've spent the last ten years thinking about how this can be achieved, and this book is the result. 

### Is this a practical book?

Yes! In a series of short chapters, using examples drawn from over 100 familiar apps, I explain the key ideas and principles and show you how to apply them. Then for readers who need more, there's an extensive collection of free-standing 'explorations' that delve more deeply into design subtleties and explain how concept design relates to everything from data abstraction to design thinking.

### Who should read it?

The book is written for everyone who creates software—programmers, software architects, program managers and UX designers; for all those who guide its development—VCs, CTOs, startup founders, marketers, analysts and consultants; for novices and experts, students and researchers; and for all of us who would like to have a deeper understanding of the software we use every day.

### Do you teach workshops?

Yes. My next round of workshops will be in early 2022: subscribe [here](/subscribe) for updates. I also offer private workshops for companies; contact [me](/author) for details.
