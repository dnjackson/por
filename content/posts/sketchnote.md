Here is a lovely sketchnote by the wonderful artist and designer [MJ Broadbent](https://mjbroadbent.com), which she [created](https://twitter.com/mjbroadbent/status/728031935998533632) live during a [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blLhklI625s) I gave about concept design at the [SATURN](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/news/article.cfm?assetid=455035) conference in 2016. Concept design has come a long way since then, but many of the key ideas are here.
